Esp32 Scale App

This is a placeholder for app code. WIP!

This will have the following functionality

1. An endpoint that will receive weight and impedance data from a device.
1. Allow setup of user profiles, including height, age, and last measured lean body mass (LBM) coefficient.
1. Logic that will view incoming data, guess which user from a profile it belongs to based on last measured LBM, assign it to that user's profile, and generate body metrics based on a combination of that weight and profile data
1. A tool that will allow someone to re-assign a measurement to another user in case the guess was wrong.
