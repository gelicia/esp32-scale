# esp32-scale
Connect a Xiaomi scale to the internet using esp32

This is heavily a WIP as I get everything figured out.

This is taking logic from https://github.com/lolouk44/xiaomi_mi_scale/ and getting it running in Arduino code so data can go somewhere a little kinder and easier to use than the Mi Fit app.

I'm building this using the [M5Stack Core2](https://shop.m5stack.com/collections/stack-series/products/m5stack-core2-esp32-iot-development-kit) but it should work for anything Arduino that has BTLE. 

Tested using a [Xiaomi Mi Body Composition Scale 2](https://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Body-Composition-Scale-Smart/dp/B07VD9F419/) (Model Number XMTZC05HM)
